Your cellular data are always avaliable for both you and Siri!\r\n-After finishing her work, unnecesarry data drain is never a thing! Siri knows how to turn them off, as well as unconnected WiFi\r\n\r\nKnown bugs:\r\n- When EarPods or AirPods are connected, you may hear a cut \\"Siri not available\\" phrase, waiting to be fixed.\r\n-The success rate of a proper WiFi connection is not 100%, the first one after respring will usually fail\r\n",
